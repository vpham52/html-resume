    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Originally from Texas - I came to Los Angeles 10 years ago to shoot my shot int he film world.
    I'm currently a video editor for social media and have surpassed millions of views on most of my videos.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoy editing, color grading and sound editing. </p>

    <p>I've always had the desire towards making my way into tech and I'm so happy I've finally made the plunge!</p>

    <p>I live in Los Angeles with my partner of eights years, married for one, and our three dogs. Samson, Miles and Romeo.</p>
